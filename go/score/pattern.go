// Pattern pairs a lowercase match phrase with the sycophancy tier it
// implies. Used as the element type of [SycophancyPatterns] and the
// re-exported [ContentShieldPatterns] introspection view.
//
// For compliance / formulaic patterns the matcher only cares about
// the phrase — those live as `[]string` ([CompliancePatterns],
// [FormulaicPatterns]) since they carry no per-entry tier metadata.
//
// Phrases are matched case-insensitively against [core.Lower] of the
// input. Construct patterns directly when extending:
//
//	score.Pattern{Phrase: "you nailed it", Tier: score.TierHollowFlattery}
type Pattern struct {
	Phrase string `json:"phrase"`
	Tier   int    `json:"tier"`
}

// SycophancyPatterns is the canonical sycophancy phrase table.
//
// Ordering inside a tier is irrelevant; the detector returns the
// MAXIMUM tier across all matched phrases. The table is exported so
// tests, ops dashboards, admin tooling, and the training-data
// validation path can introspect it without reaching into package
// internals.
//
// To add a new phrase, append it to the appropriate tier section and
// add a covering test in sycophancy_test.go.
